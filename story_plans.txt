Knights Cohort Story

Sir Ratzo was sent on a quest to retrieve Excalibur from a bandit camp in the Lawless sector
Bannerlady was sent with him as her first outing, and her role was to attempt to negotiate with the pirates, and serve as liason to any friendly factions they meet
Halla, as a senior knight, was sent to supervise them and guide them

they have some adventures as they make their way over to the lawless sector
eventually they run into a pirate, who immediately attempts to mug them. 
Halla> Ratzo, don't-
Ratzo> A duel??? We accept!!
Halla exasperated> Of course.

They lose the fight, and Emily's comms go to static.


Day 127
Pirate 2> Ohoho! A knight! I heard your order pays out ransoms. I reckon you'll fetch at least a relic of some sort.
Pirate 1> But where do we keep her until the other knights arrive...? It's not like we have prisons.
Emily> Well if I'm worth at least some magical relic, seems to me like you should keep me in your treasure vault, back at camp.
Pirate 2> Don't-
Pirate 1> You're totally right! What a great idea!
Pirate 2> How did you end up in charge...

Day 134
Emily> Ouhf!
Vault door> *slam!*
Emily, just eyes in darkness> I can't believe that worked. 
Emily, just eyes in darkness, squint> Alright. Now... where are you?
Excalibur>
Emiliy> Aha!
Emily's hands with cut ropes hanging off of them> If this sword is even half of what they say it is, it'll have no problem with that door
*no dialouge box for a second*
Emily, fierce> Have at you!!
Pirate 1> You! How'd you get out?
Pirate 2> Ugh. The giant glowing sword, maybe?
Emily, scared> Wait, that light, that's not excalibur, what is-
Core explosion flash sweeps over the scene
